This file just exist to remind me where I left off and what I am currently trying to accomplish:


Prioity is getting to GUI tests ASAP.  So no AI or tech level stuff yet, just get it to "runnnable" so we can get
test-driven dev going first.
    - We need the javascript alpha GUI going
    - We need the "start" function in its basic form
    - Sockets and Ports going, with updates being sent in input and output areas



0. Double check warnings and update() data[] nums as i think it could be off
1. Finish set_up so that map beginning is all good and ready for GUI

2. Need to define how attack works, like literal odds and calculations (right now maybe build primitive 1:1 system, throw
in some match statements or random syntax just for practice)


3. Need to add in action to recruit, i'n thinking of using the move soldiers space, since maybe can move and recruit same turn


4. Get hexes_controlled worked out in move function
