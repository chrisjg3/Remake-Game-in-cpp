General Idea is a Civ VI like game, but sped up so it can be done in one sitting and have it capture some of the early game of "mostly in the users imagination"



So I think how we have the game run is like this:

Game is a hex grid
Player vs AI, each are a civilization
Player and AI can build cities, raise armies

How we will have the game work is the hexes are data structs and keep tack of their 'state' (aka if they have a city or solider on them)
    So no need for soldier objects or anything.  We will have a struct that holds player and AI money, and progress
    And the hexes will track the rest.  won't even require dynamic building


AI Notes:
For now maybe have 2-3 AI and they just do their own thing while the player tries to find ways to win
Later we can try to make the AI a "player" itself and try to win rather then being more of an NPC
