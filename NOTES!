Things to remember:
- I build inventory add to take a & then copy item for list, this means two things:
        1. Need to have every shop have a copy, and any item on ground must be deleted after being picked up
        2. NEED to build copy constructors for items with pointers.  Shared owner pointer won't matter as I will manually reset it.



Things to do:
1. Do we need to pass player to inventory add? Is there a way to make this easier? (Inventory will be object inside of player so maybe not)
