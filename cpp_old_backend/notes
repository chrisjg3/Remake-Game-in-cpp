Things to remember:
- Right now, need to set up make file so that it can build in DIFFERENT DIRECTORIES

- I build inventory add to take a & then copy item for list, this means two things:
        1. Need to have every shop have a copy, and any item on ground must be deleted after being picked up
        2. NEED to build copy constructors for items with pointers.  Shared owner pointer won't matter as I will manually reset it.



Things to do:
1. Do we need to pass player to inventory add? Is there a way to make this easier? (Inventory will be object inside of player so maybe not)
2. Change all .hpp to .h since they are classes

3. Ideas for Base game strucutre, 3 while-loops of three 'Acts/Levels' that you can travel around but then move on, and not go back.  
We can add a save point possibly, by having a part of basefile.cpp read from a file that is saved.  Then have it skip to a certain while loop.
Could even display saves.
