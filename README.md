# International Politics Game

### Tentative Name: Modernia

This project has been re-written and re-planned many times, but as of right now I am planning to do a modern spin on games like Victoria II or Heart of Iron IV.  It will take place in present times and involve economic/government/current event management more than the military emphasis of those games.

Java Swing is the frontend and displays the screens

Rust is the backend and manages the actual "happenings" of the game
