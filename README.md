# Remake-Game

## NOTICE:

This project was orginally started as a way for me to practice random data structures as I prepped for and began fall classes (hence the cpp_backend dir).  However, now that the semester is under way, I want to convert this project to being something less about building random linked lists, binary trees, or hash maps.

Update in November: Purpose will expand on this, but this project is now a way for me to tryout and practice the things I learn in the Rust book.  There is a good chance I will try to make this a complete project at the end, although it depends on if I think this project is a good use of Rust.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to help me practice and drill into my brain the syntax and bets practices of Rust.  I had a learn_rust directort originally, but I think practicing what I learn on a real project is more useful then just copying notes from a book.

The book is very helpful and I think all their examples can find a home somewhere in this project.

This game will cover more than just practicing the book concepts, I want to tackle some "real world" problems as well and some unique solutions.  

As I side above, not sure if I will make this a legitmate project or if I will move my Rust skills to a different project once I find a good use, it all depends on where this takes me.


## Structure of the Source Code and Objects

Currently on Chapter 9+ of the book, so that is what recent edits will cover.  The pull requests names should be able to show which chapters.


Old but relevant readme stuff:
ULM may be included in the future, but for now the plan is:

The game will essentially consist of a loop of three methods:
1. Recieving player input
2. Checking for collisions, events, etc.
3. Updating the map on screen


All objects will fall under one of the above processes.s
