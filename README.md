# Remake-Game

## NOTICE:

This project was orginally started as a way for me to practice random data structures as I prepped for and began fall classes.  However, now that the semester is under way, I want to convert this project to being something less about building random linked lists, binary trees, or hash maps (since I do that in class quite often) in C++, but somewhat complete project.

I am not exactly sure of the structure or language for the game quite yet, but I am going to try and blend my old cpp code with some new Rust and Java code.

## Purpose

Note above covers most of the new intended purpose.  Although I hope to use this complete project to improve my Rust and Java skills.  

This section will be expanded as the project takes shape.


## Structure of the Source Code and Objects

ULM may be included in the future, but for now the plan is:

The game will essentially consist of a loop of three methods:
1. Recieving player input
2. Checking for collisions, events, etc.
3. Updating the map on screen


All objects will fall under one of the above processes.s



## Upcoming Plans:

- Next Branch will be working on the map and map interface, I think to do test-driven development, thats going to be the most important thing to implement
    (since this allows me to run the game and actually do stuff, even before characters or items are made)
