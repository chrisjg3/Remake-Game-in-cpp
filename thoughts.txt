Steps Want to take to keep continuos development:


1. Add all output boxes to js frontend (Like money display and maybe a gov tab)

(For below: I think node is the best way.  Abandon browser idea.  Not like I will ship it or anything)
2. Add sockets (one-way Rust->js) and get rust to tell javascript to change something

3. Add reverse where js tells rust (js->Rust) that player wants something and have rust respond and say what changed (Rust->js)

4. (add better graphics? have hexes have background like catan? ) Then start adding and planning out game mechanics
