Game Idea and Layout:

Start game where grid is built
Grid can be numbered 0..18

3 players (player himself plus two ai)
they spawn on 3, 6, and 17.

Game Pace:
Game is like Civ, you collect money to build soldiers and make your nation bigger.
You can win either by fighting both your oppenets and taking all their capital (and owning most of the tiles)
Or by science by reaching the end of the tech "tree"

Each turn there is a random chance your cities grow (start at level 1 and reach level 5)
Turn +1 Cash each turn for each level in all cities
Each turn you get +1 research for each city level

Cash is spent on buying soldiers, building buildings for bonuses, and claiming unclaimed tiles

Research is stockpiled and each time you reach 100, you discover a technology.
Once all tech is reached in yout tech level, save 200 to move to a new age.  

Ages:
Bronze - Classical Age - Medival Age - Renaissance Age - Industrial Age - Atomic Age - Information Age - Interstellar Age

You don't know what techs other natins have, but you get a notification each age upgrade. 

Each age gives you a bump in attack stats and a boost in cash and a cool ability




Turn:




Gonna write these down, but gonna pause this until I get a game up and running first

-- System Archecture:

Plan:



-- Rust Game --                                                                       -- JavaScript GUI --

em starts game
(sends map seed, player/ai start decisions)             ->                               Displays regular start map


Recieves choices                                         <-                               1st turn player choices
(formatted as what action 
they chose and on what hex/ai/whatever)


Makes changes and makes ai moves
(sends only hexes and what changed)                     ->                              Display changes slowly



                                 <-            REPEAT UNTIL GAME END         ->
