Plan:



-- Rust Game --                                                                       -- JavaScript GUI --

em starts game
(sends map seed, player/ai start decisions)             ->                               Displays regular start map


Recieves choices                                         <-                               1st turn player choices
(formatted as what action 
they chose and on what hex/ai/whatever)


Makes changes and makes ai moves
(sends only hexes and what changed)                     ->                              Display changes slowly



                                 <-            REPEAT UNTIL GAME END         ->
